## Style Guidelines

### TypeScript Style Guide

We use ESLint and Prettier for consistent code style.

**Key Guidelines:**

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Prefer `const` over `let`
- Use async/await over promises
- Write self-documenting code
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Use meaningful variable names

**Example:**

```typescript
/**
 * Sends a personalized email to a recipient
 * @param recipient - The email recipient details
 * @param template - The email template to use
 * @returns Promise resolving to send result
 */
export async function sendPersonalizedEmail(
  recipient: Recipient,
  template: EmailTemplate
): Promise<SendResult> {
  const personalizedContent = await personalizeContent(recipient, template);
  return await emailService.send({
    to: recipient.email,
    content: personalizedContent
  });
}
```

### File Structure

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ services/        # Business logic
â”œâ”€â”€ models/          # Data models
â”œâ”€â”€ api/            # API endpoints
